# mysterious messenger
A messenger program with many features such as phone calls, text messages, chatrooms, emails, and Visual Novel sections. This is an ongoing project intended to give me practice experimenting with the Ren'Py engine and its capabilities. 

## Getting Started

* If you want to run this code, you will need to download the Ren'Py engine: https://www.renpy.org/
* As of 2019-02-04 (the time of this update) the version of Ren'Py used is 7.1.3.1092
* In the Ren'Py launcher, start a new project. Go to the /game folder of the project you just created and place the provided .rpy files in there. Replace the existing screens.rpy options.rpy script.rpy and gui.rpy
* **The images and sound files used in this project are not included in the repository. Please contact me directly if you would like to request the assets.**


### Getting the Program Running

If you've set up everything properly, from the Ren'Py Launcher you should be able to select the project you created from the column on the left and hit 'Launch'. If you don't have the images/sound files, you will likely run into several "not found" errors until you've created your own replacements; otherwise, you should be able to go ahead and type in your desired name for the protagonist and check out the "Tutorial Day", which will walk you through some of the available features in the program.

### Creating your own chatrooms

Included in the repository is a file called Script Generator.xlsx as well as a User Guide.pdf The User Guide contains most of the information you'll need to get started. The spreadsheet file has an instruction tab and a several templates to facilitate turning dialogue into readable code for the program. Once you've filled out the template sheet correctly, you can simply copy-paste the code into the program and add in any outstanding features, such as choice menus or background music.
